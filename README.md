# DesigningIoT
Code Samples from ‘Designing for the Internet of Things’ 2015 course at CMU (24-884)

All samples are designed to run on the Spark Core (see Spark.io/start)

# Getting Started

This includes sample code for extracting the MAC Address of the Spark Core to register it on the CMU network. Connect the Spark to a hotspot (on your phone) or an off campus network to begin.

# Blinking an LED
The most basic example. Turn an LED on and off.
