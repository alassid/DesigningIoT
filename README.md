# DesigningIoT
Code Samples from ‘Designing for the Internet of Things’ 2015 course at CMU (24-884)

All samples are designed to run on the Particle Core (see Particle.io/start)

They also include Fritzing Diagrams and Parts lists where needed. 

# Getting Started

This includes sample code for extracting the MAC Address of a Particle Core to register it on the CMU network. First, connect your Particle Core to a hotspot (on your phone) or an off campus network to begin.

# Blinking an LED
The most basic example. Turn an LED on and off.
